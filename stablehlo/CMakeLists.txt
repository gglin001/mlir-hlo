# This build of StableHLO is meant to be embedded in MLIR-HLO.
# As a result, its root CMakeLists.txt is different from the original
# CMakeLists.txt from https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo.
# All other files of this build of StableHLO except for this one are the same
# as the original files.
# To get access to a standalone build of StableHLO, check out the
